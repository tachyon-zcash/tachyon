# Tachyon Book

## Development

You can render locally and test using `mdbook serve`. Ensure you have `mdbook v0.4.52` and `mdbook-katex v0.9.4` installed to avoid issues.

## Publication

The `main` branch of this repository, when modified, triggers a [`website`](https://github.com/tachyon-zcash/website) rebuild that will rerender this book on the public URL.
