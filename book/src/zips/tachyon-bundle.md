# Tachyon Bundle / Aggregate Transaction Format

**Tracking:** [#104](https://github.com/tachyon-zcash/tachyon/issues/104)

**('Additive / Update' ZIP, Category 'Consensus')**

## I. Dependencies

* [Tachyon Shielded Protocol (#103)](https://github.com/tachyon-zcash/tachyon/issues/103) defines the Tachyon pool, action semantics, tachygrams, keys, and the statement the stamp proof attests to.
* [Tachyon Accumulator / Hash Chain (#105)](https://github.com/tachyon-zcash/tachyon/issues/105) defines the anchor (Poseidon hash-chain state) that `anchorTachyon` references, the consensus anchor-membership rule, and the epoch window with its duplicate-tachygram rule.
* [ZIP 225](https://zips.z.cash/zip-0225) is the v5 transaction-format precedent this format follows; the withdrawn [ZIP 230](https://zips.z.cash/zip-0230) is the v6 precedent.
* [ZIP 239](https://zips.z.cash/zip-0239) defines `wtxid = txid || auth_digest`, the identifier format carried by `tachyonAggregateId`.
* [ZIP 244](https://zips.z.cash/zip-0244) defines the `txid_digest` and `auth_digest` trees.
  ZIP 244 as extended for Tachyon ([Transaction digest contributions](zip-244.md#transaction-digest-contributions)) specifies the leaf algorithms and personalizations for this bundle's digest contributions; this ZIP specifies only their inputs, as ZIP 225 defers its digest algorithms to ZIP 244.

## II. Design Considerations

This ZIP is the Tachyon analogue of [ZIP 225](https://zips.z.cash/zip-0225): the wire format of the bundle that goes on-chain.[^bundle] Its organizing principle is the effecting/authorizing split, carried down to the wire layout: the bundle body holds the bundle's contribution to the transaction's logical identity (actions and value balance) together with the signatures over it, and a state-dependent stamp holds the part that aggregation replaces (a proof, or a pointer to a covering aggregate).[^txid]

This draft adds the bundle to the existing transaction format as a new section, in the manner of ZIP 225's shielded fields.
It does not build on the extensible transaction-format proposal ([ZIP-248](https://github.com/zcash/zips/pull/1156)); see the open questions.

The [Tachyon Aggregator Protocol (#106)](https://github.com/tachyon-zcash/tachyon/issues/106) builds on this ZIP: it defines the aggregation lifecycle, the mempool and relay policy, and the autonome, aggregate, and adjunct transaction roles.
This ZIP defines the proof and pointer stamp forms and the adjunct bundle those roles build on; the draft body below otherwise speaks of the covering transaction without naming the roles.

[^bundle]: See [Bundle](../bundle.md) for the bundle lifecycle and state machine.

[^txid]: See [Transaction Identifiers](../transaction-identifiers.md) for how the split keeps `txid` stable while `auth_digest` tracks the authorization form.

Open questions:

* **ZIP-248 migration.** If the extensible transaction format ([ZIP-248](https://github.com/zcash/zips/pull/1156)) lands, the bundle re-registers as a `(bundleType, bundleVariant)` TLV entry (see [the ZIP-248 entry](zip-248.md) and the registration draft in [tachyon-zcash/zips#4](https://github.com/tachyon-zcash/zips/pull/4)).
Under TLV framing, absence of the entry encodes "no bundle", making the `0x00` state byte redundant there.
* **Proof-size constant.** A fixed-size `proofTachyon` is the working assumption: its length is a constant of the Ragu proof system, not yet numerically frozen, so this draft names it symbolically as `PROOF_SIZE`.
A variable-size final compression (bulletproof-style) would replace the constant-length field with a dynamic one; whether the proof system settles on a fixed size is unresolved.
* **Zero-action coverage confirmation.** Block validity confirms an adjunct bundle's reference through its actions, so an adjunct bundle with no actions names a covering aggregate that consensus does not confirm.
Two candidate rules:
  
  1. Validators holding mempool data locate a proof-stamped form matching the adjunct bundle's `txid`, identify its tachygram set, and confirm that set folded into the referenced aggregate.
  Multiple proof-stamped candidates may exist.
  Requires no changes to bundle format.
  Significantly, this check depends on ephemeral mempool state.
  2. A field is added to the bundle identifying the bundle's tachygram set at creation.
  The field contributes to `txid` and the sighash.
  A validator must confirm that an adjunct bundle's tachygram set MUST be a complete subset of the referenced aggregate's stamp.
  The body field survives stripping and does not depend on mempool state.
  Significantly, this extends the definition of effecting data beyond actions and balance.

* **Tachygram arity.** A spend emits two tachygrams and an output emits one, so a stamp's tachygram count bears no fixed relation to the actions it covers.
  Fixing the arity at two per action, and consequently removing `hStampActionsTachyon` in favor of total reconstruction, is deferred to [#164](https://github.com/tachyon-zcash/tachyon/issues/164).
* **In-band memo data.** An optional in-band path for memo data, committed by a `da_digest` contribution to the transaction digests, is deferred to [#163](https://github.com/tachyon-zcash/tachyon/issues/163).
* **Count caps.** Only the compactSize maximum `0x02000000` bounds `nActionsTachyon` and `nTachygrams`.
  A tighter per-field cap may be wanted.

The digest leaf algorithms and personalizations live in [ZIP 244 as extended for Tachyon](zip-244.md#transaction-digest-contributions); see that page for their normative form.

This draft stages the ZIP body below inside the Tachyon mdBook, so two conventions differ from a standalone ZIP and normalize on migration to `tachyon-zcash/zips`: the book reserves the top-level `#` heading for the page title, so the ZIP's own sections use `##` and `###` here and each promotes by one level (`#`, `##`) when the ZIP stands alone; and external ZIP and protocol references are written as full `https://zips.z.cash/` links for the book, where a standalone ZIP omits that prefix per the ZIP style guide.

## Terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "MAY", and "RECOMMENDED" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [^BCP14] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals.

The term "network upgrade" is to be interpreted as described in ZIP 200.
[^zip-0200] The terms "Testnet" and "Mainnet" are to be interpreted as described in § 3.12 ‘Mainnet and Testnet’.
The character § is used when referring to sections of the Zcash Protocol Specification.[^protocol]

`txid`, `auth_digest`, and the SIGHASH transaction hash are defined by ZIP 244 [^zip-0244]; `wtxid = txid || auth_digest`, the 64-byte identifier used for transaction announcement and relay, by ZIP 239 [^zip-0239].
Value commitments, spend authorization signatures, and binding signatures are existing constructions (§ 5.4.8.3 ‘Homomorphic Pedersen commitments (Sapling and Orchard)’, § 4.15 ‘Spend Authorization Signature (Sapling and Orchard)’, and § 4.14 ‘Balance and Binding Signature (Orchard)’, respectively, in their Orchard instantiations); this ZIP applies them to Tachyon as specified below rather than redefining them.

The following terms are defined by other Tachyon ZIPs and summarized here non-normatively:

Tachygram
:   The `byte[32]` encoding of a field element ($\mathbb{F}_p$) representing either a note nullifier or a note commitment.
    Consensus treats nullifiers and commitments identically (see [Tachyon Shielded Protocol](tachyon-shielded-protocol.md)).

Anchor
:   A Poseidon hash-chain state referencing the *Tachyon pool* at a specific block.
    Sub-block states may be valid but should not be acknowledged (see [Tachyon Accumulator / Hash Chain](tachyon-accumulator.md#anchor-semantics)).

The remaining terms are defined by this ZIP:

Bundle
:   The Tachyon section of a transaction: actions, a value balance, action signatures, a binding signature, and a state-dependent stamp.

Covering transaction
:   The proof-stamped transaction whose stamp covers a pointer-stamped transaction's actions, named by the pointer-stamped bundle's `tachyonAggregateId`.

Bundle state
:   The three-valued wire discriminator `tachyonBundleState` selecting no bundle, a proof stamp, or a pointer stamp.

Action
:   The triple $(\mathsf{cv}, \mathsf{rk}, \mathsf{sig})$: a value commitment, a randomized verification key, and a signature over the transaction sighash.
    An action effects a spend or an output; both forms share this encoding, and consensus applies the same rules to each.

Action digest
:   The Poseidon digest of an action's $(\mathsf{cv}, \mathsf{rk})$ pair.

Descriptor digest
:   The BLAKE2b-256 digest of a sequence of action descriptors (see [Action descriptor digests](#action-descriptor-digests)).

Multiset commitment
:   A deterministic, order-independent, multiplicity-preserving commitment to a multiset of field elements (see [Multiset commitments](#multiset-commitments)); a stamp's proof binds two, `cStampActionsTachyon` and `cTachygrams`.

Stamp
:   The final section of a bundle, following the body: either a proof stamp or a pointer stamp.

Proof stamp
:   A stamp carrying a Ragu proof and supporting verification data: a digest of the covered actions, an anchor, and the stamp's tachygrams.
    The proof attests that every covered action satisfies the Tachyon action rules.

Pointer stamp
:   A stamp carrying `tachyonAggregateId`, the `wtxid` of a covering transaction, in place of a proof.

## Abstract

This ZIP specifies the consensus wire format of the Tachyon bundle: a three-state discriminator byte, a bundle body carrying actions, a value balance, and signatures, and a stamp carrying either a proof (with the public data needed to verify it) or a pointer to a covering transaction.
It defines the canonical field encodings and sequence orders, the action digests, descriptor digests, and multiset commitments cited by the other Tachyon ZIPs, the bundle's transaction-digest inputs, the consensus rules scoped to a single bundle, and the block-scoped rules that validate a block's bundles together.
It plays the role for the *Tachyon pool* that ZIP 225 [^zip-0225] plays for the v5 transaction.

## Motivation

Tachyon proofs aggregate: the stamps of many transactions merge into one covering stamp, and covered transactions appear in a block without their own.
The transaction format must therefore allow a stamp to be removed without changing the transaction's identity and without invalidating any signature.
This forces the effecting/authorizing split down into the wire layout: the bundle's contribution to the signed data is confined to the body and is identical across bundle states, while the strippable part is isolated in the stamp.

A single format serves every transaction role: one proof-stamped form whether the proof covers only the bundle's own actions or other transactions' as well, and a covered transaction is the same body under a pointer stamp.
Every consensus check on a pointer-stamped transaction operates on data it still carries.

## Requirements

* A transaction's `txid` contribution is invariant across stamping, merging, stripping, and re-stamping.
* Proof-stamped and pointer-stamped forms carry identical effecting data; only the stamp differs.
* Every field a validator needs for signature and balance verification is present in both states.
* Encodings are canonical: each parsed bundle has exactly one serialization.
* The proof field has a fixed size, so parsing requires no untrusted length.
* Bundles with no actions are representable, under both stamp forms.

## Non-requirements

This ZIP does not specify:

* the proof statement, which is specified by the [Tachyon Shielded Protocol](tachyon-shielded-protocol.md#proof-verification) ZIP;
* anchor semantics or the anchor-membership rule, and the epoch window with its duplicate-tachygram rule, which are specified by the [Tachyon Accumulator / Hash Chain](tachyon-accumulator.md) ZIP;
* the transaction digest trees, the digest leaf algorithms, or the sighash algorithm, which are specified by ZIP 244 [^zip-0244] as extended for Tachyon ([Transaction digest contributions](zip-244.md#transaction-digest-contributions));
* the aggregation lifecycle, mempool, and relay policy;
* the position of the bundle section within the transaction encoding, which is specified by the transaction format of the activating network upgrade.

## Specification

The specification proceeds from the wire layout of the bundle body to the rules over its fields, the digest and commitment constructions those rules use, the two stamp forms, the canonical encodings of every field, the bundle's transaction-digest inputs, a consolidated summary of the bundle-scoped consensus rules, and the block-scoped rules that validate a block's bundles together.

### Placement and bundle states

The Tachyon bundle is a contiguous section of the transaction encoding, added by a Tachyon network upgrade.
The first byte of the section, `tachyonBundleState`, selects the bundle state:

| value         | state         | bundle contents                                       |
| ------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `0b0000_0000` | non-tachyon   | no bundle                                             |
| `0b0000_0001` | proof stamp   | bundle with actions digest, anchor, tachygrams, proof |
| `0b0000_0010` | pointer stamp | bundle with covering transaction's wtxid              |
| `...`         | *reserved*    | *n/a*                                                 |

A parser MUST reject any other value of `tachyonBundleState`.
When `tachyonBundleState` is `0x00`, the section is the single discriminator byte and no further fields follow.

The complete wire layout across the serialized states:

| Note              | Bytes                      | Name                   | Data Type                        | Description                                                             |

The bundle lifecycle also passes through states with no wire representation: a bundle awaiting its proof, and a pointer-stamped transaction whose covering transaction is not yet assigned.
Only the proof-stamp and pointer-stamp states serialize; the lifecycle itself is not specified by this ZIP.

### Bundle body

When `tachyonBundleState` is not `0x00`, the body follows the discriminator byte, laid out as in the wire layout above.

`valueBalanceTachyon` is a two's-complement signed 64-bit integer in little-endian byte order.
`vActionsTachyon` is a sequence of `nActionsTachyon` action descriptors, each the 32-byte encoding of $\mathsf{cv}$ followed by the 32-byte encoding of $\mathsf{rk}$.
`vActionSigsTachyon` is a sequence of `nActionsTachyon` 64-byte signatures; the $i$-th signature authorizes the $i$-th descriptor.
Both sequences share the single count `nActionsTachyon`, so a count mismatch between descriptors and signatures is unrepresentable.
The descriptor sequence's order is the transaction author's choice.
The semantics of the actions themselves (what a spend or an output effects in the pool) are specified by the [Tachyon Shielded Protocol](tachyon-shielded-protocol.md) ZIP.

### Value balance and the binding signature

`valueBalanceTachyon` asserts the net value of the bundle's actions, spends minus outputs.
A positive balance releases value from the *Tachyon pool* to the rest of the transaction; a negative balance absorbs value into it.
The balance is not required to be zero: a transaction MAY balance across pools, and a coinbase transaction MAY absorb newly created value.
Value accounting across a whole transaction is a transaction-layer rule, not specified here.

Value commitments and balance enforcement are Orchard's constructions, unchanged.
Each action's $\mathsf{cv}$ is a homomorphic Pedersen commitment (§ 5.4.8.3 ‘Homomorphic Pedersen commitments (Sapling and Orchard)’) to the action's value, using Orchard's value-commitment generators (the `z.cash:Orchard-cv` hash-to-curve domain) and the net-value sign convention of § 4.14 ‘Balance and Binding Signature (Orchard)’: each $\mathsf{cv}$ commits to $+v$ for a spend and $-v$ for an output, so their homomorphic sum commits to spends minus outputs, which is exactly `valueBalanceTachyon`.
The binding validating key $\mathsf{bvk}$ is derived from the actions' $\mathsf{cv}$ values and `valueBalanceTachyon` exactly as in § 4.14, and is not encoded in the transaction.
`bindingSigTachyon` MUST be a valid binding signature over the transaction sighash under the derived $\mathsf{bvk}$; a valid signature enforces consistency between the asserted balance and the hidden action values.

### Action signatures

Each action signature in `vActionSigsTachyon` MUST be a valid spend authorization signature (§ 4.15 ‘Spend Authorization Signature (Sapling and Orchard)’; RedPallas with the SpendAuth basepoint of § 5.4.7.1, for spends and outputs alike) over the transaction sighash under the corresponding action's $\mathsf{rk}$.
The sighash is a transaction-level digest, computed as specified by ZIP 244 [^zip-0244] as extended for Tachyon ([Transaction digest contributions](zip-244.md#transaction-digest-contributions)); all of a bundle's signatures sign the same sighash.

### Action digests

Each action has an action digest, a Poseidon hash of its $(\mathsf{cv}, \mathsf{rk})$ pair.
Let $(\mathsf{cv}_x, \mathsf{cv}_y)$ and $(\mathsf{rk}_x, \mathsf{rk}_y)$ be the affine Pallas coordinates of the action's decompressed $\mathsf{cv}$ and $\mathsf{rk}$.
Then

$$
  d = \mathrm{Poseidon}\bigl(
    \mathsf{dom},\ \mathsf{cv}_x,\ \mathsf{cv}_y,\ \mathsf{rk}_x,\ \mathsf{rk}_y
  \bigr)
$$

where $\mathsf{dom}$ is the Pallas base field element whose integer value is the little-endian interpretation of the 16-byte ASCII string `Tachyon-ActionDg`.
The Poseidon instance (width, rounds, round constants, and mode) is the instance fixed by the Ragu proof system.

If an action's $\mathsf{cv}$ or $\mathsf{rk}$ is the identity point, it has no affine coordinates, the digest is undefined, and the transaction is invalid.

### Action descriptor digests

An action's descriptor is its 64-byte encoding in `vActionsTachyon`: the 32-byte encoding of $\mathsf{cv}$ followed by the 32-byte encoding of $\mathsf{rk}$.
The descriptor digest of a sequence of actions is the BLAKE2b-256 hash, with personalization `Tachyon-Actions`, of the concatenation of their descriptors:

$$
  \mathsf{h} = \text{BLAKE2b-256}\bigl(
    \text{"Tachyon-Actions"},\ \mathsf{cv}_1 \| \mathsf{rk}_1 \| \cdots \| \mathsf{cv}_n \| \mathsf{rk}_n
  \bigr)
$$

The digest of the empty sequence is the hash of the empty string under the same personalization.

This construction is used for two distinct digests, over two distinct sequences:

* `hActionsTachyon`, an input to the effecting digest contribution ([ZIP 244 as extended for Tachyon](zip-244.md#transaction-digest-contributions)), is computed over the bundle's own actions in their `vActionsTachyon` wire order.
  It is not carried on the wire.
* `hStampActionsTachyon`, carried on the proof stamp ([Proof stamp](#proof-stamp)), is computed over every action a proof stamp covers, first sorted into ascending lexicographic order.
  Sorting makes it a function of the covered action multiset alone, independent of which transactions contributed it, or in what order a merge combined them.

### Multiset commitments

A multiset of field elements is committed by taking its members as the roots of a monic polynomial and committing to that polynomial's coefficients.
For action digests $d_i$ and tachygrams $t_j$:

$$ A(X) = \prod_i \bigl(X - d_i\bigr) \qquad T(X) = \prod_j \bigl(X - t_j\bigr) $$

The commitment to a polynomial of degree $n$ is the deterministic, untrapdoored Pedersen commitment to its $n+1$ coefficients over the Vesta group, using the polynomial-commitment generators fixed by the Ragu proof system.
The coefficients are ordered by ascending degree: the constant term pairs with the first generator, the degree-$k$ coefficient with the $k$-th.
A polynomial is invariant under permutation of its roots, and a repeated member becomes a repeated root, so the commitment depends only on the multiset, with multiplicity, and never on any ordering.
The empty multiset has no commitment.

A stamp's proof binds two multiset commitments: `cStampActionsTachyon`, over the digests of every action the stamp covers ($A$), and `cTachygrams`, over the stamp's tachygrams ($T$).
Both are deterministic functions of the public data they commit to and carry no information beyond it.

### Proof stamp

When `tachyonBundleState` is `0x01`, the proof stamp follows the body, laid out as in the wire layout above.

`hStampActionsTachyon` is the descriptor digest ([Action descriptor digests](#action-descriptor-digests)) over every action the stamp covers: the bundle's own actions together with the actions of every covered transaction.
How a block's actions are checked against it is specified in [Block validity](#block-validity).

`anchorTachyon` references the pool state the proof is valid against; its semantics and the anchor-membership rule are specified by the [Tachyon Accumulator / Hash Chain](tachyon-accumulator.md) ZIP.

`vTachygrams` publishes the stamp's tachygram multiset for data availability.
Which tachygrams an action contributes is specified by the [Tachyon Shielded Protocol](tachyon-shielded-protocol.md) ZIP; this ZIP imposes no relation between `nTachygrams` and `nActionsTachyon`, and a stamp covering actions that are not the bundle's own carries their tachygrams too.
The tachygrams within one proof stamp MUST be distinct; a transaction violating this rule is invalid.
Block-level distinctness is a block-validity rule of this ZIP ([Block validity](#block-validity)); epoch-window distinctness is specified by the [Tachyon Accumulator / Hash Chain](tachyon-accumulator.md#epoch-window) ZIP.

`proofTachyon` is the Ragu proof.
The statement it attests to, and the base rule that a stamp proof MUST verify against the Tachyon statement, are specified by the [Tachyon Shielded Protocol](tachyon-shielded-protocol.md#proof-verification) ZIP; how that rule is applied to a block's stamps is specified in [Block validity](#block-validity).

### Pointer stamp

When `tachyonBundleState` is `0x02`, the pointer stamp follows the body, laid out as in the wire layout above.

`tachyonAggregateId` is the `wtxid` (ZIP 239 [^zip-0239]) of a covering transaction.
It MUST NOT be all zero; the rule applies to every pointer-stamped transaction, with or without actions.
Which transaction it must identify within a block is specified in [Block validity](#block-validity).

### Canonical encodings

* Every compactSize field MUST use the minimal encoding for its value (§ 7.1 ‘Transaction Encoding and Consensus’) and MUST NOT encode a value exceeding `0x02000000`.
  A parser MUST reject any other encoding.
* `cv` and `rk` are 32-byte compressed encodings of Pallas points.
A parser MUST reject an encoding that does not decode to a point.
`rk` MUST decode as a RedPallas validating key (§ 5.4.7 ‘RedDSA, RedJubjub, and RedPallas’).
  The identity point decodes successfully; it is excluded by the rule in [Action digests](#action-digests), not by the parser.
* `anchorTachyon` and each tachygram are canonical little-endian encodings of Pallas base field elements; a parser MUST reject an encoding whose value is not less than the field modulus.
* `vActionsTachyon` carries no ordering requirement: the descriptors may appear in any sequence the transaction author chooses.
The signatures in `vActionSigsTachyon` follow their descriptors' positions regardless of that order.
* The tachygrams in `vTachygrams` MUST be in ascending lexicographic order of their 32-byte encodings; a parser MUST reject a stamp whose tachygrams are out of order.
  With the distinctness rule ([Proof stamp](#proof-stamp)) the sequence is strictly increasing.
* `hStampActionsTachyon` is an opaque 32-byte string at parse time; whether it matches the covered actions is a block-validity property ([Block validity](#block-validity)).
* Signatures (`vActionSigsTachyon`, `bindingSigTachyon`) are opaque 64-byte strings at parse time; their validity is a verification-time property.
* `proofTachyon` is exactly `PROOF_SIZE` bytes and MUST decode as a Ragu proof.
  The proof encoding is defined by the Ragu proof system.

### Transaction digest contributions

The bundle contributes one leaf to each of the transaction's two digest trees (ZIP 244 [^zip-0244]).
This section states what the bundle supplies to each; the leaf algorithms and personalizations are specified by ZIP 244 as extended for Tachyon ([Transaction digest contributions](zip-244.md#transaction-digest-contributions)).

The effecting contribution (to `txid` and the sighash) commits to `hActionsTachyon`, the descriptor digest over the bundle's own actions ([Action descriptor digests](#action-descriptor-digests)), and to `valueBalanceTachyon`.
`hActionsTachyon` is distinct from `hStampActionsTachyon`, which may cover more actions than the bundle's own.
The stamp is excluded, so the contribution is invariant across stamping, merging, stripping, and re-stamping.

The authorizing contribution (to `auth_digest`) commits to the action and binding signatures and to the stamp, the latter through the 64-byte `stamp_digest` whose algorithm the ZIP 244 update specifies: a proof stamp's covered-actions digest and remaining fields, or a pointer stamp's `tachyonAggregateId` directly.

A transaction with no Tachyon bundle contributes distinctly from a bundle with no actions: no bundle produces the empty preimage, while every bundle's effecting contribution contains its encoded balance and its authorizing contribution contains at least its binding signature and `stamp_digest`.

### Bundle validity

The rules owned by this ZIP, applying to a single transaction's bundle:

1. `tachyonBundleState` MUST be `0x00`, `0x01`, or `0x02`.
2. Every compactSize MUST be minimally encoded and MUST NOT exceed `0x02000000`.
3. Every point and field-element encoding MUST be canonical, and every sequence in canonical order, as specified in [Canonical encodings](#canonical-encodings).
4. An action's $\mathsf{cv}$ and $\mathsf{rk}$ MUST NOT be the identity point.
5. Every action signature MUST verify over the transaction sighash under its action's $\mathsf{rk}$.
6. `bindingSigTachyon` MUST verify over the transaction sighash under the derived $\mathsf{bvk}$.
7. `valueBalanceTachyon` MUST be in the range $-\mathrm{MAX\_MONEY}$ to $\mathrm{MAX\_MONEY}$ inclusive.
8. A bundle with no actions MUST have `valueBalanceTachyon` equal to $0$.
9. A proof stamp's `proofTachyon` MUST be exactly `PROOF_SIZE` bytes and a valid proof encoding, and its tachygrams MUST be distinct.
10. An pointer stamp's `tachyonAggregateId` MUST NOT be all zero.

Rules outside the scope of this ZIP are enumerated in [Non-requirements](#non-requirements).

### Block validity

The rules owned by this ZIP that constrain a block's Tachyon bundles together:

* All tachygrams in a block MUST be distinct.
* Every pointer-stamped transaction MUST bear a `tachyonAggregateId` referring to the proof-stamped transaction in the same block covering its actions.
* Every proof-stamped Tachyon transaction MUST bear an `hStampActionsTachyon` matching the descriptor digest of the complete set of actions of its covered transactions in the same block.
* All proofs in a block MUST verify.

A validator enforces these fail-fast, in this order:

1. **Tachygram uniqueness.** The block's tachygrams are the multiset union of the `vTachygrams` of every proof stamp.
   A single scan enforces this rule and the per-bundle distinctness of [Bundle validity](#bundle-validity) rule 9 together; reject on any duplicate.
   Reuse within the wider epoch window is governed by the epoch-window rule ([Tachyon Accumulator / Hash Chain](tachyon-accumulator.md#epoch-window)).
2. **Proof coverage.** The `tachyonAggregateId` of every pointer-stamped transaction MUST identify a proof-stamped transaction in the same block; reject if absent or not proof-stamped.
   A pointer-stamped transaction with no actions satisfies this check against any proof-stamped transaction in the block: it contributes no action descriptors to step 3, so consensus attaches no further meaning to its reference.
3. **Covered-actions digest per stamp.** For each proof stamp, collect the descriptors of the bundle's own actions together with those of every pointer-stamped transaction naming it, sort them, and compute the descriptor digest ([Action descriptor digests](#action-descriptor-digests)); reject on mismatch with the carried `hStampActionsTachyon`.
  The check is a sort and one BLAKE2b-256 hash, with no curve arithmetic.
4. **Proof verification.** Every proof stamp MUST verify.
   The validator reassembles the stamp PCD from `proofTachyon`, `anchorTachyon`, `cTachygrams`, and `cStampActionsTachyon` formed over the confirmed action set's digests ([Action digests](#action-digests), [Multiset commitments](#multiset-commitments)); reject if any proof fails.
   The base requirement that a proof verifies the Tachyon statement is the shielded-protocol rule ([Tachyon Shielded Protocol](tachyon-shielded-protocol.md#proof-verification)); these items apply it per stamp within a block.

## Rationale

This subsection is non-normative.

### The stamp is excluded from the txid contribution

The effecting contribution commits only to actions and balance, so stamping, merging, stripping, and re-stamping preserve a transaction's logical identity.
This is the property the aggregation lifecycle rests on: a pointer-stamped transaction in a block is the same transaction its author signed.

### Zero-action balance

The v5 analogue omits `valueBalanceOrchard` when the action count is zero and defines its value as zero in that case.
Tachyon gates field presence on the bundle state, not the action count: the non-tachyon state omits the field, while a present bundle always encodes `valueBalanceTachyon`.
A present bundle with no actions therefore still carries the field, so the zero balance is stated as an explicit rule.

### Identity points are invalid

The action digest hashes affine coordinates, which the identity point lacks.
Excluding it also rejects a degenerate verification key and a degenerate value commitment.

### `hStampActionsTachyon` is sorted for reconstruction agreement

`hStampActionsTachyon` can cover many transactions' actions, combined by whatever merge tree an aggregator chose.
Sorting before hashing makes it a function of the covered multiset alone, so any party reconstructs the same digest regardless of merge history.
The multiset commitments ([Multiset commitments](#multiset-commitments)) get this order-independence for free, as polynomial multiplication.

### `vTachygrams` is sorted against `wtxid` malleability

The stamp is authorizing data that no signature covers ([Signatures survive stripping](#signatures-survive-stripping)), and the proof commits to `vTachygrams` order-independently, so only a canonical order pins its wire form.
Without one, an observer could reorder `vTachygrams` to mint a distinct `wtxid` for byte-identical semantic content.
Requiring sorted order gives it the one serialization that `vActionsTachyon` gets from its signature coverage instead.

### A flat hash, not an algebraic commitment, carries the covered actions

The carried field serves coverage identification and fail-fast confirmation.
The proof binds the action set through `cStampActionsTachyon`, which validators reconstruct from the confirmed actions, so the carried field needs no algebraic structure: a flat hash commits the covered multiset just as well, reconstructs with no curve arithmetic, and puts no unverified group element on the wire.

### Deterministic multiset commitments

The committed multisets are public data, so a hiding commitment is unnecessary; determinism is what lets any party recompute a commitment from the data it covers.

### Fixed-size proof

Recursion yields one proof size whether a stamp covers one action or a block's worth.
A constant-size field needs no untrusted length prefix, and a stamp size independent of coverage underlies aggregation's space savings.

### `wtxid`, not `txid`, in `tachyonAggregateId`

A `txid` is ambiguous across the authorization forms that share it; the `wtxid` pins the physical covering transaction, stamp included, which is what the pointer-stamped transaction needs to reference.

### Nonzero `tachyonAggregateId`

Every pointer-stamped bundle names a covering transaction, and the unassigned pointer state has no valid wire form.
An all-zero `wtxid` (which names no transaction) is invalid.

## Security Implications

This subsection is non-normative.

### Canonical encodings, except action order

Every field but `vActionsTachyon` has exactly one accepted serialization, so a bundle cannot be re-encoded into a second accepted serialization except by permuting its actions.
That permutation is not a malleability concern: it changes `hActionsTachyon`, and therefore the sighash every signature covers, so a re-ordered bundle needs new signatures, not just new bytes.
Leaving action order to the author's choice is the same property Sapling and Orchard rely on for their own unordered spend, output, and action arrays.
Authorization-form changes (re-stamping, stripping) produce distinct bundles by design and are reflected in `auth_digest` and `wtxid` (ZIP 239 [^zip-0239]).

### Balance consistency is enforced by the binding property

A valid binding signature establishes that `valueBalanceTachyon` equals the net value committed by the actions' $\mathsf{cv}$, by the same binding argument as Orchard (§ 4.14).

### Signatures survive stripping

All signatures cover the transaction sighash, which incorporates only effecting data.
A miner stripping a proof stamp changes no signed data, so aggregation does not invalidate signatures.
A signature authorizes only the sighash it signs; using an action in a transaction with different effecting data requires a new signature over that transaction's sighash.

<div class="note">

Parse validity is not spend validity.
A bundle that parses and whose signatures verify is not thereby valid to spend; the rules enumerated in [Non-requirements](#non-requirements) also apply.
Implementers and auditors should not assume the rules in this ZIP alone establish those properties.

</div>

## Privacy Implications

This subsection is non-normative.

### Public data

$\mathsf{cv}$ is a hiding commitment to the action's value.
The unlinkability properties of $\mathsf{rk}$, and of tachygrams (which do not distinguish nullifiers from note commitments), are established by the [Tachyon Shielded Protocol](tachyon-shielded-protocol.md) ZIP, not by this format.
The action count, the value balance, and, on a proof-stamped bundle, the tachygram count are public, as is anything derivable from them.

## Deployment

This ZIP is deployed with a Tachyon network upgrade.
Activation parameters are specified by the corresponding deployment ZIP ([Network Upgrade Deployment](network-upgrade-deployment.md)).

## Reference implementation

A reference implementation of the bundle wire codec, the digest and commitment constructions, the value balance, the digest contributions, and signature verification is developed in the `zcash_tachyon` crate of the Tachyon repository: <https://github.com/tachyon-zcash/tachyon>.
