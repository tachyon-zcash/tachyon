/// A tachygram is a field element ($\mathbb{F}_p$) representing either a

/// The accumulator does not distinguish between commitments and nullifiers.

/// actions. The invariant is consistency between the listed tachygrams

/// Consensus rejects a published tachygram that has already appeared in
/// any block of the current or immediately preceding epoch. See the
/// Tachygrams book chapter for why the window spans two epochs.
