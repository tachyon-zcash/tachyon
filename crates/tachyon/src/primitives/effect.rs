//! Compile-time effect markers for spend vs output actions.

//! [`Spend`] and [`Output`] are zero-sized marker types that parameterize
//! [`Plan`](crate::action::Plan),
//! [`ActionRandomizer`](crate::entropy::ActionRandomizer),
//! [`ActionSigningKey`](crate::keys::private::ActionSigningKey), and key types
//! to enforce the spend/output distinction at compile time.
